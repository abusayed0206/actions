# Custom Github Actions for personal use
 Here are some github actions which I have created for my personal use. You can use them as well if you want. 

## Listed below:
1. Domain Notifier(WHOIS Report,Validity etc) directly to your Telegram.
2. Cloudflare, Vercel etc site build hook trigger on daily basis.
3. Mirror all of my github repos to codeberg & gitlab.
4. Download watched movies from trakt.tv and convert it to letterboxd compatible CSV format and notify me on telegram.
